# Sets the plugin's own version in the three files that carry it.
#
# **Not the same version as `platformApi`.** That one is the host contract the backend compiled against, it
# lives in four other places, and it is bumped only when the SDK moves. This is the wiki's own SemVer, and
# nothing in a plugin repo keeps its three copies in step — which is exactly the kind of drift that produces
# a release whose tag, manifest and jar disagree about what they are. `ci.yml` fails the build if they do,
# and this is the script that stops that from happening in the first place.
#
#   scripts/set-version.sh 0.2.0
#
# Then: ./build.sh, run both test suites, commit, tag `v0.2.0`, and publish the GitHub release — the release
# workflow refuses a tag that disagrees with the manifest, so a bump forgotten here is caught there too,
# just much later.
