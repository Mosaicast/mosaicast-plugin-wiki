# Project: Mosaicast – mosaicast-plugin-wiki

Site plugin: a simple wiki via the declarative schema provider (pages, revisions, search).

## Read first (mandatory)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — source of truth for the whole system. On conflict, this file wins.
- `docs/BRIEF.md` — what THIS repo builds, scope, public contract, tasks.

Read both fully before writing code. Work in plan mode first.

## Tech stack
Java 21 (Gradle, PF4J extension) · React + Vite (Web Component)

## Commands
```
./build.sh        # -> dist/
cd backend && ./gradlew test  ;  cd ../frontend && npm test
```

## Conventions (binding)
- Java packages `dev.mosaicast.*`; npm scope `@mosaicast`.
- Plugins import ONLY against the SDK, never against core code.
- The manifest `platformApi` must match the built SDK version.
- Never commit secrets; configure via `.env` / environment variables.
- Migrations exclusively via Flyway.
- **Tests are part of the work** (see DoD in the BRIEF, ARCHITECTURE §13.5; plugins test against the SDK test kit).
- **CI:** create and maintain `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (build + tests on every PR) as soon as the build exists; the Definition of Done includes green CI.
- **Document public APIs** (Javadoc/TSDoc); take SDK signatures from the built SDK docs, don't guess (§3.5).
- **Sign off commits** (`git commit -s`, DCO).
- **SPDX header in EVERY new source file**:
  `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later`
  `// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 The Mosaicast Authors`
  Don't guess the copyright holder from git config — use this fixed value. CI blocks PRs without a header.

## Architecture guardrails (do not violate)
- Identity (`EpisodeRef`) is separate from presentation (feed snapshot). Runtime/date in the core display come from the feed; plugin metrics are non-authoritative and live only in the plugin UI.
- The host resolves scopes and decides access/filters — plugins only consume.
- The generic doc store is the default; schema tables only platform-mediated (declarative).

## Keep docs current (continuously)
- Keep **README.md** and **this CLAUDE.md** up to date (commands, structure, setup, conventions) — repo-local, your job.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md and BRIEF.md are READ-ONLY specs** — don't change them unilaterally; flag deviations.
- Keep CLAUDE.md slim (< ~200 lines); leave incidental learnings to Claude Code's auto memory.

## Plugin-dev skill (check before building)
This repo is meant to be built with the shared **writing-a-mosaicast-plugin** skill (from the `mosaicast-skills` marketplace). Before scaffolding or modifying plugin code, check whether that skill is among your available skills.
- Available -> use it.
- Not available -> **pause**, tell the user it's recommended and how to install it (see CONTRIBUTING -> "Recommended skill"), and proceed without it only if the user confirms.

## When unsure
Ask, or note the assumption visibly, instead of silently diverging from ARCHITECTURE.md.
